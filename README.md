# Financial Document Analyzer - Debug Assignment

## Project Overview
A comprehensive financial document analysis system that processes corporate reports, financial statements, and investment documents using AI-powered analysis agents.

## Getting Started

### Install Required Libraries
```sh
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Sample Document
The system analyzes financial documents like Tesla's Q2 2025 financial update.

**To add Tesla's financial document:**
1. Download the Tesla Q2 2025 update from: https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/TSLA-Q2-2025-Update.pdf
2. Save it as `data/sample.pdf` in the project directory
3. Or upload any financial PDF through the API endpoint

**Note:** Current `data/sample.pdf` is a placeholder - replace with actual Tesla financial document for proper testing.

Fixed main.py by adding PDF file validation, handling empty queries, and properly passing inputs to the Crew pipeline.
Combined outputs from multiple agents into a readable format.
Added fallback error handling to save results even if Crew processing fails
Fixed agents.py by properly initializing the LLM with Groq, correcting tool assignments for all agents, and updating backstories, goals, and execution settings for professional behavior.
Removed placeholder/fake values and ensured memory, max_rpm, and delegation flags were set correctly.
These changes make the Crew pipeline run smoothly with all agents.
Fixed tools.py by converting async methods to synchronous _run methods for reliable Crew integration.
Replaced PDF reading logic with PyPDFLoader, added file existence checks, and improved text cleanup.
Enhanced Investment and Risk tools to return clear, formatted, actionable outputs instead of placeholders.
