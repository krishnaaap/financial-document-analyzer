# Financial Document Analyzer - Debug Assignment

## Project Overview
A comprehensive financial document analysis system that processes corporate reports, financial statements, and investment documents using AI-powered analysis agents.

## Getting Started

### Install Required Libraries
```sh
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

### Sample Document
The system analyzes financial documents like Tesla's Q2 2025 financial update.

**To add Tesla's financial document:**
1. Download the Tesla Q2 2025 update from: https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/TSLA-Q2-2025-Update.pdf
2. Save it as `data/sample.pdf` in the project directory
3. Or upload any financial PDF through the API endpoint

**Note:** Current `data/sample.pdf` is a placeholder - replace with actual Tesla financial document for proper testing.

Fixed main.py by adding PDF file validation, handling empty queries, and properly passing inputs to the Crew pipeline.
Combined outputs from multiple agents into a readable format.
Added fallback error handling to save results even if Crew processing fails
